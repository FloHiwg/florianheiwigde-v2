# Hi, I'm Florian 👋

Product-focused technical leader with 10+ years of experience owning complex software systems in regulated and high-growth environments. Known for quickly understanding new domains, structuring ambiguity, and leading teams through sound architectural and product decisions. Proven at delivering reliable, cost-efficient platforms through hands-on technical judgment and clear ownership. This site is a collection of my technical notes, philosophical musings, and travel stories with my wife.
