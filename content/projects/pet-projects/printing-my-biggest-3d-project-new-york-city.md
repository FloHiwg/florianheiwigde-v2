## Introduction

After reaching the limits of my Ender, I decided to switch to a Bambu Lab printer.

With the Ender, I spent a lot of time adjusting settings again and again just to get consistent, decent results. It worked, but it was a constant tuning loop.

With the Bambu Lab, things were different right away. It worked out of the box, and I could focus more on projects instead of calibration.

That change led to my biggest print so far.

## The Idea

One day I came across a large New York City print and immediately liked the aesthetic.

The final size was huge for my standards: **70 cm by 120 cm**, split into **28 tiles**.

At first, I was mostly thinking about whether I could actually pull it off and how I would mount it cleanly once all parts were done. I decided to start anyway and solve problems one by one.

## Printing the 28 Tiles

The printing phase was straightforward but long. Tile by tile, the city started to come together and take shape on a side board behind me in my office room and occupying soon a significant portion of the space.

After a while, I had almost all parts printed and the project finally looked real. At that point, the harder part started: finding a stable base plate for that size.

## Mounting Challenges

My first idea was acrylic, but getting the right size and thickness was surprisingly difficult and expensive.

So I went with **Forex** instead and ordered a plate sized **128 cm by 78 cm**. That gave me a **4 cm border** around the print on all sides.

When it arrived, I realized it was not stiff enough on its own.

I first added a metal frame on the back made of flat bars, but it still flexed too much. The final fix was gluing two **L-profiles** to the back on the longer side on top of the flat bars, which made the whole plate rigid enough.

Before attaching everything, I drilled holes in the profiles so I could hang the full piece on the wall later.

## Final Assembly

For attaching the tiles, I used **Orabond double-sided tape**.

To make placement cleaner and more secure, I built a support out of magazines underneath so the plate could lie flat on the table while I pressed from the top. That helped each tile bond properly and stay in place.

After the final tiles were in, the result looked exactly how I hoped.

## Final Result

The finished piece is very stiff, looks great on the wall, and weighs about **6 kg**.

This project was a good reminder that large 3D prints are not only about printing time. A big part of the work is structural planning, mounting, and solving problems that only show up at full scale.
