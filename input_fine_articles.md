Sure — here are the two longer story messages you shared (the audio transcriptions), copied as they appear in the chat:

1) First long story message (timeline + growth + gym case + settlement + market tightening)

The whole thing started right before, right after Corona, so at the beginning of Corona. So 2021, in the beginning of 2021, we restarted off the whole topic, especially with gambling. More and more users came in, and we were kind of like the best we could have. We were the first company, basically, in Germany with the first website that was the first thing that people were finding when they googled for the issue. And if they got aware of this, whenever there was a news article in some of the media outlets, people were flowing in to our website because they were googling it and find us as the first hit on Google. This was giving us the best customers. Even though we tested over the time also different other sources like partners, someone who was distributing leads to us or also some paid marketing like social or search engine advertisement, but nothing worked as good as organic traffic onto the page with organic customers. They were always performing way better than everything you could buy. We also had one bigger case in the beginning, which was right during Corona. People realized that the gyms got closed during the lockdowns and people were not able to get into their gyms, but they had to pay their fees, but which was not legal. So they could claim the money back. And we did this big time. So we helped customers to send letters out to the gyms to ask them for their fees back. And this worked really well and we got a share. Oh, and then we got a fixed fee for that, just like 20 euros per customer. But did this with a lot of people, like multiple hundreds, a thousand people, a thousand people. So it worked pretty well and it was pretty easy to process with our platform that we just put together on our own. We could, very really easy to generate these letters and every Friday, sending out like multiple hundreds of envelopes, bringing them to the post office and sending them out. It was pretty, pretty crazy. This was also bringing us a good revenue. We were also as a company helping a preceding process financing, litigation financing company to operate their claims. So a little bit like an agency or consultancy. We were the customer support and the operating company behind their money kind of. So they paid a law firm and they were the litigation financer and we were the operating part for the cases, which was a great opportunity to get money, actually revenue for the company and sustain your own business. But also to learn how these cases work and work together with the company, the legal firm and stuff like that. So this was pretty nice. It was also the way how we found the legal firm we worked with later on with the gambler cases when we also found a own litigation financing company we worked with and that helped us to finance our cases. Later we were also providing leads to other third-party companies, either litigation financing companies or also matching companies that helped to match litigation financing with the law firm. So yeah, there were a lot of different integrations we had with different players in the market to make money and to help the customers to get their money back. The most interesting part was, I think it was 2022, in winter, we were right before Christmas, like in November, December, we got the biggest mass settlement closed we had until this point and also had since then, which was against one casino, one big casino in Germany. And they were pretty big in Germany, not a German casino, but the headquarters were on Malta, Maltese company. And yeah, right before Christmas, we were able to pay out a lot of money, like seven digits amount of money to consumers in Germany, right before Christmas. And yeah, these people were for sure, they’re a little bit desperate because they are lost a lot of money in casinos and it’s usually not on their free will. They have kind of like no choice and during Corona, they were isolated, they were lonely, and they, yeah, they went into the internet and they were the casino casinos offering some kind of like good feelings, some dopamine, stuff like that. And they were for sure ashamed about the money they lost. And in front of the family, they started to betray family and friends about money, lend money from friends, and they usually are highly in debt after they kind of like end their career as a gambler. Most of the people are just losing. That’s for sure. So and this gave them, I think, a lot of, yeah, for sure money to have a great Christmas, buying presents, but also getting some justice and some good feeling of, yeah, I got betrayed. I got tricked into paying this money into the casino and Losing the money in the casino, and it’s not only my fault, and yeah, they got a feeling of justice that I think this is really what I’ve got, and where there were so many people thinking of us in emails right around Christmas. This was really an amazing feeling, and we showed that this is something really worth doing. Unfortunately, afterwards, everything got a little bit stuck in the European, there were some regulations coming up that made the market tighter, harder to enforce the claims. The companies got protected by Malta, especially as a European country. Claims got unenforceable and therefore it was really, yeah, hard to continue in this market. Also other, the German courts were getting slower and slower. There were the diesel scandal and a lot of other big mass claims from consumers out there that were making, yeah, clogging up the justice system. And…

2) Second long story message (purpose of the article + context: sale + shutdown + CV proof)

I would like to use this article as kind of like one part showing my entrepreneurial spirit, but also showcasing my product skills, my product skill set, and my technical skill set. Like, I used this blog for, yeah, showing the companies I will apply to, what I’ve done, and because the company is now getting out of business after we sold it 2024, it’s now getting out of business 2026. And yeah, I would like to have this as a proof of that I’ve done something during this time and what this company was, is on my CV and yeah.

If you want, I can also turn each of these into a clean, structured “notes” version (bullet timeline + key metrics + lessons) that’s easier to paste into Codex or directly into the draft.
