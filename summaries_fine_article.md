Goal of the blog article

You want to write a blog article about the company you started. The article should:
	•	Tell the founder story in a clear, structured way.
	•	Showcase your entrepreneurial spirit plus your product and technical skill set (as proof for companies you apply to).
	•	Serve as a credible “portfolio artifact” since the company is on your CV and is winding down by 2026.
	•	Be honest and reflective (including hard lessons), not salesy.

You also want help deciding whether it should be one post or multiple. We concluded a single polished article is best for your job-application use case, with optional follow-up posts later if needed.

Chosen title

You chose this title:

“Building a Legal Claims Platform in Germany (2021–2026): Product, Growth, and Hard Lessons”

⸻

Current recommended structure (single article)

We agreed on a one-article structure that doubles as story + portfolio, with clear milestones and explicit “what I owned” sections.

Proposed sections:
	1.	Lead / hook (1 paragraph)

	•	Problem space: unclaimed consumer refunds / legal claims people don’t pursue.
	•	What you built: a claims platform + operational engine.
	•	Timeline outcome: started 2021 → peak around 2022 settlement → sold 2024 → wind-down by 2026.

	2.	Context / insight (early 2021)

	•	Corona-era conditions and consumer/legal gaps, especially around online gambling claims.
	•	Thesis: convert complex legal processes into a simple flow.

	3.	Phase 1: Scrappy validation (2021)

	•	Landing pages + manual workflows.
	•	Key learning: organic/search demand outperformed paid/partner leads.

	4.	Mini case study: Gym lockdown refunds (during lockdown period)

	•	Gyms closed, fees still charged → customers could reclaim fees.
	•	You scaled it operationally: generated letters, stuffed/enveloped, and mailed hundreds weekly.
	•	Pricing: fixed fee ~€20 per customer.
	•	Volume: multiple hundreds to ~1,000 customers.
	•	This produced meaningful early revenue and was easy to process with your early platform tooling.

	5.	Phase 2: From service to platform (2021–2022)

	•	You built internal/external tooling to handle intake, tracking, document generation, and comms.
	•	Aim: scale case processing, reduce manual work, build trust with status transparency.

	6.	Distribution / growth

	•	You were effectively among the first in Germany with a dedicated website for the gambling claims issue.
	•	When media outlets covered the topic, users googled and found you as a top result.
	•	Organic traffic brought the best customers (highest intent, best conversion).
	•	You tested other channels (lead partners, paid search/social), but organic performed best.

	7.	Ecosystem & partnerships

	•	Early revenue and learning also came from operating for a litigation finance / process financing company:
	•	You acted as the operating layer (customer support + case operations).
	•	They financed claims and paid a law firm; you ran execution.
	•	This helped fund your company and taught you how cases work end-to-end.
	•	Through this you later found a law firm you worked with for gambling cases.
	•	You later worked with another litigation finance partner to finance cases.
	•	You also provided leads to third parties (litigation finance companies and matching companies).

	8.	Peak milestone: Mass settlement payout (Nov/Dec 2022)

	•	Before Christmas 2022, you closed your biggest mass settlement (to date) against a large casino with HQ in Malta.
	•	You paid out a seven-digit total amount to consumers in Germany right before Christmas.
	•	Human impact: many customers were isolated during Corona, gambling addiction/shame/debt; payout provided both financial relief and a sense of justice. You received thankful emails around Christmas.

	9.	Market turns / constraints (post-2022 into 2023–2024)

	•	The market became harder: regulations and Malta-related protections made claims harder to enforce.
	•	German courts slowed down due to system congestion (diesel scandal and other mass claims), making enforcement and throughput more difficult.
	•	Result: continuing in that market became much harder.

	10.	Exit & wind-down

	•	Company was sold in 2024.
	•	It is now going out of business / winding down by 2026 (context: market/regulatory tightening, enforceability and court speed).

	11.	Explicit portfolio section: “What I personally owned”
This should be clearly enumerated for employers:

	•	Product discovery → MVP → roadmap and prioritization.
	•	Growth experiments and channel learning (SEO/organic vs paid/partners).
	•	Platform building: intake, workflows, status transparency, automation, reporting.
	•	Operations scaling: batch letter creation, high-volume handling, customer support systems.
	•	Partner integrations: law firms, litigation financiers, lead partners.

	12.	Lessons learned
Tight, employer-relevant bullets such as:

	•	High-intent organic beats bought traffic in this category.
	•	Turning operations into software is a scaling superpower.
	•	In regulated markets, enforceability is a product requirement.
	•	Partnerships can be distribution and risk.
	•	Volume forces automation.

	13.	Career-oriented closing
A non-salesy CTA framed for hiring:

	•	open to product/tech roles where you build end-to-end systems, work cross-functionally, handle ambiguity.

Screenshot plan (key new requirement)

You want to add screenshots of your landing pages and customer portal across stages. This is meant to provide strong “artifact proof” of product evolution and your technical/product capabilities.

You said you have screenshots of:
	•	The very first flow
	•	Early customer portal
	•	Landing page(s)
	•	The final customer portal with:
	•	AI features to analyze documents
	•	questionnaires to profile customers and suggest new cases
	•	an “explore” page
	•	a case tracking page showing progress through the process

Recommended placement and purpose of screenshots:
	•	Use them as milestone artifacts at transitions (MVP → platform → mature system).
	•	Ideal number: 2–6 (7 is still okay if each is justified).
	•	Caption template proposed:
	•	When
	•	Goal
	•	What changed vs previous
	•	Result (metric or directional outcome)
	•	Caution: blur/redact sensitive info (partners, customer data, case IDs, financial terms).

Suggested mapping:
	1.	2021 MVP landing page + first flow → validation section
	2.	Early customer portal → service-to-platform section
	3.	Mature portal overview → platform era section
	4.	AI doc analysis screen → technical depth section
	5.	Questionnaire profiling + case suggestion → product strategy/retention section
	6.	Explore page → discovery/cross-sell UX section (optional if too many)
	7.	Case tracking page → trust/transparency/ops rigor section

Next step discussed (not yet done):
	•	Upload screenshots (or a PDF), then:
	•	order them by stage,
	•	write captions in your voice,
	•	integrate them into the outline,
	•	recommend redactions.

⸻

Timeline (what’s established)
	•	Start / core focus: early 2021, during/just after Corona onset context, with a major focus on gambling claims.
	•	Early growth: SEO/organic search, demand spikes after media coverage; tested paid and partners but organic best.
	•	Gym refunds case: during lockdowns; high-volume letter ops; fixed fee model.
	•	Partner ops work: operated cases for a litigation finance company; learned; found legal partners.
	•	Peak milestone: Nov/Dec 2022 mass settlement; seven-digit payout; casino HQ Malta.
	•	Constraints: post-2022 regulation + enforceability challenges + slower courts.
	•	Sale: 2024.
	•	Wind-down: company exiting by 2026.

⸻

Current status
	•	Structure is defined, title chosen, screenshot integration strategy defined.
	•	No prose draft written yet; we are still at outline/architecture stage.
	•	Next execution step would be turning the outline into a filled skeleton or full draft and incorporating screenshot captions once screenshots are provided.
